It is typically used in conjunction with the SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to specify the criteria for retrieving, modifying, or removing data from a table.\n  \n  The WHERE clause is essential when you want to retrieve specific data from a table based on certain criteria. For example, you might want to retrieve all the records of customers from a specific city or all the orders placed on a particular date.\n  \n  The condition in the WHERE clause can be a simple expression or a combination of expressions using logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT. The expressions can also involve comparison operators (=, >, <, >=, <=, <>), pattern matching with LIKE, or other SQL functions.\n  \n  The WHERE clause can also be used with the UPDATE and DELETE statements to modify or remove records that meet certain conditions.\n  \n  It's important to note that the WHERE clause should come after the FROM clause in a SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.

The expressions can also involve comparison operators (=, >, <, >=, <=, <>), pattern matching with LIKE, or other SQL functions.\r\n  \r\n  The WHERE clause can also be used with the UPDATE and DELETE statements to modify or remove records that meet certain conditions.\r\n  \r\n  It's important to note that the WHERE clause should come after the FROM clause in a SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. Additionally, proper use of parentheses and logical operators is crucial when constructing complex conditions involving multiple expressions.\r\n  \r\n  ### Examples\r\n  \r\n  #### Simple WHERE Clause\r\n  This query retrieves employees who work in the 'Sales' department:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales';\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### WHERE Clause with Multiple Conditions\r\n  This query retrieves employees who work in the 'Sales' department and have a salary greater than 50000:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales' AND Salary > 50000;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### WHERE Clause with OR Condition\r\n  This query retrieves employees who work in the 'Sales' department or have a salary greater than 50000:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales' OR Salary > 50000;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### WHERE Clause with LIKE Operator\r\n  This query retrieves employees whose first name starts with 'J':\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees WHERE FirstName LIKE 'J%';\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### WHERE Clause with BETWEEN Operator\r\n  This query retrieves employees whose salary is between 40000 and 60000:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 60000;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  These examples illustrate how the WHERE clause can be used to filter data based on various conditions.\r\n  `,\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'ORDER BY Statement',\r\n    path: 'order-by-statement',\r\n    content: `  The ORDER BY clause in SQL is used to sort the result set returned by a SELECT statement in either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order based on one or more columns.\r\n    Sorting data is often necessary when you want to present the retrieved information in a specific order, such as alphabetically by name, chronologically by date, or numerically by a specific column value.\r\n    Here's the general syntax for using the ORDER BY clause:\r\n\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT column1, column2, ...\r\n  FROM table_name\r\n  ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  ### Examples\r\n  \r\n  #### ORDER BY Single Column\r\n  This query retrieves all customers ordered by their age in descending order:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Age DESC;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### ORDER BY Multiple Columns\r\n  This query retrieves all customers ordered first by their last name in ascending order and then by their first name in ascending order:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY LastName ASC, FirstName ASC;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### ORDER BY with Numeric Values\r\n  This query retrieves all products ordered by their price from lowest to highest:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT * FROM Products ORDER BY Price ASC;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### ORDER BY with Date Values\r\n  This query retrieves all orders ordered by their order date from newest to oldest:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT * FROM Orders ORDER BY OrderDate DESC;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### ORDER BY with Aliases\r\n  This query retrieves all employees ordered by their years of experience (calculated as an alias):\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, (CURRENT_DATE - HireDate) AS YearsOfExperience\r\n  FROM Employees\r\n  ORDER BY YearsOfExperience DESC;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  These examples illustrate how the ORDER BY clause can be used to sort data in various ways based on different criteria.`,\r\n  },\r\n  // Add more topics as needed\r\n];\r\n\r\nconst TopicDetail = ({ match }) => {\r\n  const topic = topics.find(t => t.path === match.params.topicId);\r\n  return topic ?
