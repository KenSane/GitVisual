It allows users to access the data and retrieve specific data based on specific conditions. We can fetch either the entire table or according to some specified rules. The data returned is stored in a result table. This result table is also called the result set.\n\n  With the SELECT clause of a SELECT command statement, we specify the columns that we want to be displayed in the query result and, optionally, which column headings we prefer to see above the result table. The SELECT clause is the first clause and is one of the last clauses of the select statement that the database server evaluates.\n\n  The reason for this is that before we can determine what to include in the final result set, we need to know all of the possible columns that could be included in the final result set.\n\n  Here's a basic example of a SELECT statement:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n\n  You can also use the SELECT statement with various clauses to filter, sort, and group the data:\n  - **WHERE**: To filter rows based on specific conditions.\n  - **ORDER BY**: To sort the result set.\n  - **GROUP BY**: To group rows sharing a property so that an aggregate function can be applied to each group.\n\n  ### Examples\n\n  #### Simple SELECT Query\n  This query retrieves all columns from the \"Employees\" table:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT * FROM Employees;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n\n  #### SELECT with WHERE Clause\n  This query retrieves employees who work in the 'Sales' department:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales';\n  \\`\\`\\`\n\n  #### SELECT with ORDER BY Clause\n  This query retrieves employees ordered by their last name:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName ASC;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n\n  #### SELECT with GROUP BY Clause\n  This query retrieves the count of employees in each department:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT Department, COUNT(*) as NumberOfEmployees FROM Employees GROUP BY Department;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n\n  These are some of the common usages of the SELECT statement in SQL. Each example demonstrates a specific aspect of retrieving data using the SELECT statement.`\n}, {\n  name: 'WHERE Clause',\n  content: `\n  The WHERE clause in SQL is used to filter records or rows from a table based on one or more conditions. It is typically used in conjunction with the SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to specify the criteria for retrieving, modifying, or removing data from a table.\n  \n  The WHERE clause is essential when you want to retrieve specific data from a table based on certain criteria. For example, you might want to retrieve all the records of customers from a specific city or all the orders placed on a particular date.\n  \n  The condition in the WHERE clause can be a simple expression or a combination of expressions using logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT. The expressions can also involve comparison operators (=, >, <, >=, <=, <>), pattern matching with LIKE, or other SQL functions.\n  \n  The WHERE clause can also be used with the UPDATE and DELETE statements to modify or remove records that meet certain conditions.\n  \n  It's important to note that the WHERE clause should come after the FROM clause in a SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. Additionally, proper use of parentheses and logical operators is crucial when constructing complex conditions involving multiple expressions.\n  \n  ### Examples\n  \n  #### Simple WHERE Clause\n  This query retrieves employees who work in the 'Sales' department:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales';\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  \n  #### WHERE Clause with Multiple Conditions\n  This query retrieves employees who work in the 'Sales' department and have a salary greater than 50000:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales' AND Salary > 50000;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  \n  #### WHERE Clause with OR Condition\n  This query retrieves employees who work in the 'Sales' department or have a salary greater than 50000:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales' OR Salary > 50000;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  \n  #### WHERE Clause with LIKE Operator\n  This query retrieves employees whose first name starts with 'J':\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees WHERE FirstName LIKE 'J%';\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  \n  #### WHERE Clause with BETWEEN Operator\n  This query retrieves employees whose salary is between 40000 and 60000:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 60000;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  \n  These examples illustrate how the WHERE clause can be used to filter data based on various conditions.\n  `\n}, {\n  name: 'ORDER BY Statement',\n  content: `  The ORDER BY clause in SQL is used to sort the result set returned by a SELECT statement in either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order based on one or more columns.\n    Sorting data is often necessary when you want to present the retrieved information in a specific order, such as alphabetically by name, chronologically by date, or numerically by a specific column value.\n    Here's the general syntax for using the ORDER BY clause:\n\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT column1, column2, ...\n  FROM table_name\n  ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  ### Examples\n  \n  #### ORDER BY Single Column\n  This query retrieves all customers ordered by their age in descending order:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Age DESC;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  \n  #### ORDER BY Multiple Columns\n  This query retrieves all customers ordered first by their last name in ascending order and then by their first name in ascending order:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY LastName ASC, FirstName ASC;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  \n  #### ORDER BY with Numeric Values\n  This query retrieves all products ordered by their price from lowest to highest:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT * FROM Products ORDER BY Price ASC;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  \n  #### ORDER BY with Date Values\n  This query retrieves all orders ordered by their order date from newest to oldest:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT * FROM Orders ORDER BY OrderDate DESC;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  \n  #### ORDER BY with Aliases\n  This query retrieves all employees ordered by their years of experience (calculated as an alias):\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, (CURRENT_DATE - HireDate) AS YearsOfExperience\n  FROM Employees\n  ORDER BY YearsOfExperience DESC;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n  \n  These examples illustrate how the ORDER BY clause can be used to sort data in various ways based on different criteria.`\n}, {\n  name: 'INSERT INTO Statements',\n  content: `The INSERT INTO statement in SQL is used to add new rows or records to an existing table in a database. It is one of the fundamental operations in SQL, along with SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE, for managing data in tables.\n    \n  The INSERT INTO statement is typically used when you need to insert new data into a table, such as adding a new customer record to a customers table, or inserting a new order into an orders table.\n  \n  The INSERT INTO statement specifies the table name into which you want to insert the new row(s). The list of columns within the parentheses is optional, but if provided, it should match the order of the values specified in the VALUES clause.\n  \n  If you omit the column list, you must provide values for all columns in the table, respecting the order in which the columns were defined during table creation.\n  \n  ### Examples\n  \n  #### Insert a Single Row\n  This query inserts a new customer into the Customers table:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)\n  VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B.

We can update single columns as well as multiple columns using the UPDATE statement as per our requirement. When changing a row in a table, the SQL UPDATE statement uses locks on each row; after the row is changed, the lock is released. As a result, it can use a single query to modify one row or several rows.\n\n  The basic syntax of the UPDATE statement is:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  UPDATE table_name\n  SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...\n  WHERE condition;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n\n  ### Examples\n\n  #### Update a Single Column\n  This query updates the last name of an employee with EmployeeID = 1:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  UPDATE Employees\n  SET LastName = 'Smith'\n  WHERE EmployeeID = 1;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n\n  #### Update Multiple Columns\n  This query updates the last name and department of an employee with EmployeeID = 1:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  UPDATE Employees\n  SET LastName = 'Smith', Department = 'HR'\n  WHERE EmployeeID = 1;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n\n  #### Update with a Condition\n  This query updates the salary of employees in the 'Sales' department:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  UPDATE Employees\n  SET Salary = Salary * 1.10\n  WHERE Department = 'Sales';\n  \\`\\`\\`\n\n  #### Update Using Subquery\n  This query updates the department of employees whose ID matches with a list from another table:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  UPDATE Employees\n  SET Department = 'Finance'\n  WHERE EmployeeID IN (SELECT EmployeeID FROM TempEmployees WHERE Department = 'Finance');\n  \\`\\`\\`\n\n  #### Update with JOIN\n  This query updates the salary of employees based on a value from another table:\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\n  UPDATE Employees\n  SET Employees.Salary = TempEmployees.Salary\n  FROM Employees\n  INNER JOIN TempEmployees ON Employees.EmployeeID = TempEmployees.EmployeeID;\n  \\`\\`\\`\n\n  These examples demonstrate how the UPDATE statement can be used to modify existing records in a table under various conditions and scenarios.`\n}, {\n  name: 'AGGREGATE Functions',\n  content: `Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement. The GROUP BY clause splits the result-set into groups of values and the aggregate function can be used to return a single value for each group.\nThe most commonly used SQL aggregate functions are:\n- MIN() - returns the smallest value within the selected column\n- MAX() - returns the largest value within the selected column\n- COUNT() - returns the number of rows in a set\n- SUM() - returns the total sum of a numerical column\n- AVG() - returns the average value of a numerical column\n\n### Examples\n\n#### MIN() Function\nThe MIN() function returns the smallest value in a set of values. It is often used with numeric columns but can also be used with date columns to find the earliest date:\n\\`\\`\\`sql\nSELECT MIN(Salary) AS LowestSalary FROM Employees;\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n#### MAX() Function\nThe MAX() function returns the largest value in a set of values. It is often used with numeric columns but can also be used with date columns to find the latest date:\n\\`\\`\\`sql\nSELECT MAX(Salary) AS HighestSalary FROM Employees;\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n#### COUNT() Function\nThe COUNT() function returns the number of rows that match a specified criterion. It is commonly used to count the number of rows in a table or the number of non-NULL values in a column:\n\\`\\`\\`sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees FROM Employees;\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n#### SUM() Function\nThe SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column. It is often used to calculate the total of a particular column for a group of rows:\n\\`\\`\\`sql\nSELECT SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalaries FROM Employees;\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n#### AVG() Function\nThe AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column. It is often used to calculate the average of a particular column for a group of rows:\n\\`\\`\\`sql\nSELECT AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary FROM Employees;\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### Using Aggregate Functions with GROUP BY\n\nAggregate functions are commonly used with the GROUP BY clause to group the result-set by one or more columns and then apply the aggregate function to each group:\n\n#### GROUP BY with COUNT()\nThis query retrieves the number of employees in each department:\n\\`\\`\\`sql\nSELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees\nFROM Employees\nGROUP BY Department;\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n#### GROUP BY with SUM()\nThis query retrieves the total salaries paid in each department:\n\\`\\`\\`sql\nSELECT Department, SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalaries\nFROM Employees\nGROUP BY Department;\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n#### GROUP BY with AVG()\nThis query retrieves the average salary in each department:\n\\`\\`\\`sql\nSELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary\nFROM Employees\nGROUP BY Department;\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n#### GROUP BY with MIN() and MAX()\nThis query retrieves the lowest and highest salary in each department:\n\\`\\`\\`sql\nSELECT Department, MIN(Salary) AS LowestSalary, MAX(Salary) AS HighestSalary\nFROM Employees\nGROUP BY Department;\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nThese examples illustrate how aggregate functions can be used to perform calculations on sets of values and how they can be combined with the GROUP BY clause to organize the result-set into meaningful groups.`\n}, {\n  name: 'DELETE Statement',\n  content: `The existing table's records can be deleted using the SQL DELETE Statement. We must utilize the WHERE clause in conjunction with the DELETE statement in order to filter the data that need to be deleted (or, delete specific entries).

It allows users to access the data and retrieve specific data based on specific conditions. We can fetch either the entire table or according to some specified rules. The data returned is stored in a result table. This result table is also called the result set.\r\n\r\n  With the SELECT clause of a SELECT command statement, we specify the columns that we want to be displayed in the query result and, optionally, which column headings we prefer to see above the result table. The SELECT clause is the first clause and is one of the last clauses of the select statement that the database server evaluates.\r\n\r\n  The reason for this is that before we can determine what to include in the final result set, we need to know all of the possible columns that could be included in the final result set.\r\n\r\n  Here's a basic example of a SELECT statement:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n\r\n  You can also use the SELECT statement with various clauses to filter, sort, and group the data:\r\n  - **WHERE**: To filter rows based on specific conditions.\r\n  - **ORDER BY**: To sort the result set.\r\n  - **GROUP BY**: To group rows sharing a property so that an aggregate function can be applied to each group.\r\n\r\n  ### Examples\r\n\r\n  #### Simple SELECT Query\r\n  This query retrieves all columns from the \"Employees\" table:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT * FROM Employees;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n\r\n  #### SELECT with WHERE Clause\r\n  This query retrieves employees who work in the 'Sales' department:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales';\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n\r\n  #### SELECT with ORDER BY Clause\r\n  This query retrieves employees ordered by their last name:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName ASC;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n\r\n  #### SELECT with GROUP BY Clause\r\n  This query retrieves the count of employees in each department:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT Department, COUNT(*) as NumberOfEmployees FROM Employees GROUP BY Department;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n\r\n  These are some of the common usages of the SELECT statement in SQL.

It is typically used in conjunction with the SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to specify the criteria for retrieving, modifying, or removing data from a table.\r\n  \r\n  The WHERE clause is essential when you want to retrieve specific data from a table based on certain criteria. For example, you might want to retrieve all the records of customers from a specific city or all the orders placed on a particular date.\r\n  \r\n  The condition in the WHERE clause can be a simple expression or a combination of expressions using logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT. The expressions can also involve comparison operators (=, >, <, >=, <=, <>), pattern matching with LIKE, or other SQL functions.\r\n  \r\n  The WHERE clause can also be used with the UPDATE and DELETE statements to modify or remove records that meet certain conditions.\r\n  \r\n  It's important to note that the WHERE clause should come after the FROM clause in a SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. Additionally, proper use of parentheses and logical operators is crucial when constructing complex conditions involving multiple expressions.\r\n  \r\n  ### Examples\r\n  \r\n  #### Simple WHERE Clause\r\n  This query retrieves employees who work in the 'Sales' department:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales';\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### WHERE Clause with Multiple Conditions\r\n  This query retrieves employees who work in the 'Sales' department and have a salary greater than 50000:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales' AND Salary > 50000;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### WHERE Clause with OR Condition\r\n  This query retrieves employees who work in the 'Sales' department or have a salary greater than 50000:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales' OR Salary > 50000;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### WHERE Clause with LIKE Operator\r\n  This query retrieves employees whose first name starts with 'J':\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees WHERE FirstName LIKE 'J%';\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### WHERE Clause with BETWEEN Operator\r\n  This query retrieves employees whose salary is between 40000 and 60000:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 60000;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  These examples illustrate how the WHERE clause can be used to filter data based on various conditions.\r\n  `,\r\n     \r\n    },\r\n      {\r\n      name: 'ORDER BY Statement',\r\n      content: `  The ORDER BY clause in SQL is used to sort the result set returned by a SELECT statement in either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order based on one or more columns.\r\n    Sorting data is often necessary when you want to present the retrieved information in a specific order, such as alphabetically by name, chronologically by date, or numerically by a specific column value.\r\n    Here's the general syntax for using the ORDER BY clause:\r\n\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT column1, column2, ...\r\n  FROM table_name\r\n  ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  ### Examples\r\n  \r\n  #### ORDER BY Single Column\r\n  This query retrieves all customers ordered by their age in descending order:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Age DESC;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### ORDER BY Multiple Columns\r\n  This query retrieves all customers ordered first by their last name in ascending order and then by their first name in ascending order:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY LastName ASC, FirstName ASC;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### ORDER BY with Numeric Values\r\n  This query retrieves all products ordered by their price from lowest to highest:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT * FROM Products ORDER BY Price ASC;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### ORDER BY with Date Values\r\n  This query retrieves all orders ordered by their order date from newest to oldest:\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT * FROM Orders ORDER BY OrderDate DESC;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  #### ORDER BY with Aliases\r\n  This query retrieves all employees ordered by their years of experience (calculated as an alias):\r\n  \\`\\`\\`sql\r\n  SELECT FirstName, LastName, (CURRENT_DATE - HireDate) AS YearsOfExperience\r\n  FROM Employees\r\n  ORDER BY YearsOfExperience DESC;\r\n  \\`\\`\\`\r\n  \r\n  These examples illustrate how the ORDER BY clause can be used to sort data in various ways based on different criteria.`,\r\n\r\n  },\r\n      \r\n    {\r\n      name: 'INSERT INTO Statements',\r\n      content: `The INSERT INTO statement in SQL is used to add new rows or records to an existing table in a database.
