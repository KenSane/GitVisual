    name: 'SELECT Statement',
    content: `The SELECT statement in SQL is used to fetch or retrieve data from a database. It allows users to access the data and retrieve specific data based on specific conditions. We can fetch either the entire table or according to some specified rules. The data returned is stored in a result table. This result table is also called the result set.

With the SELECT clause of a SELECT command statement, we specify the columns that we want to be displayed in the query result and, optionally, which column headings we prefer to see above the result table. The SELECT clause is the first clause and is one of the last clauses of the select statement that the database server evaluates.

The reason for this is that before we can determine what to include in the final result set, we need to know all of the possible columns that could be included in the final result set.`,

  },    
  {
    name: 'WHERE Statement',
    content: `The WHERE clause in SQL is used to filter records or rows from a table based on one or more conditions. It is typically used in conjunction with the SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to specify the criteria for retrieving, modifying, or removing data from a table.

The WHERE clause is essential when you want to retrieve specific data from a table based on certain criteria. For example, you might want to retrieve all the records of customers from a specific city or all the orders placed on a particular date.

The condition in the WHERE clause can be a simple expression or a combination of expressions using logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT. The expressions can also involve comparison operators (=, >, <, >=, <=, <>), pattern matching with LIKE, or other SQL functions.

The WHERE clause can also be used with the UPDATE and DELETE statements to modify or remove records that meet certain conditions.

It's important to note that the WHERE clause should come after the FROM clause in a SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. Additionally, proper use of parentheses and logical operators is crucial when constructing complex conditions involving multiple expressions.`,

    name: 'ORDER BY Statement',
    content: `The ORDER BY clause in SQL is used to sort the result set returned by a SELECT statement in either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order based on one or more columns.

Sorting data is often necessary when you want to present the retrieved information in a specific order, such as alphabetically by name, chronologically by date, or numerically by a specific column value.

Here's the general syntax for using the ORDER BY clause:`,

The INSERT INTO statement is typically used when you need to insert new data into a table, such as adding a new customer record to a customers table, or inserting a new order into an orders table.

The INSERT INTO statement specifies the table name into which you want to insert the new row(s). The list of columns within the parentheses is optional, but if provided, it should match the order of the values specified in the VALUES clause.

If you omit the column list, you must provide values for all columns in the table, respecting the order in which the columns were defined during table creation.`,

    When changing a row in a table, the SQL UPDATE statement uses locks on each row; after the row is changed, the lock is released. As a result, it can use a single query to modify one row or several rows.
